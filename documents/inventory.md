# Draft: inventory

This is an idea. It's not implemented. I'm considering adding this. Proposed by `Magnum Oops` on lab42 discord.

An inventory of objects.

Go to a room, pick an object, save it into the inventory.

Go to another room, compare objects with what you have in the inventory.

Imaginary in the sense that it is independent from the main grid until you send it there. You could have a fixed number of object grids, select the grid like you do color and send pixels there. It would also be interesting to add the option to step into the object grids, effectively making it a 3D world. The reason for this is that some objects are partially occluded and need tweaking.

Creating new rooms on demand, where a room contains an often occurring object across many training pairs.
