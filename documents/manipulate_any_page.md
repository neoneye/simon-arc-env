# Draft: Manipulate any page

This is an idea. It's not implemented. I'm considering adding this.

Make these actions available on every page: `rotate`, `flip`, `change offset`.

Several of the ARC tasks does rotation and flipping.

Out of 3 training pairs, there may be 1 pair where the orientation is rotated by 90 degrees.
Here it could be handy being able to manipulate the inconsistent training pair, so all the training pairs gets normalized.
