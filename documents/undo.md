# Draft: undo action

This is an idea. It's not implemented. I'm considering adding this. Proposed by `Magnum Oops` on lab42 discord.

An `undo action` may help, since some mistakes can be quite punishing.

The `submit action` cannot be undone. It's the last action where the predictions gets submitted and it stops the game. This is where the most reward/punishment is being given.

However all the other actions could benefit having an `undo action` that reverses it.
